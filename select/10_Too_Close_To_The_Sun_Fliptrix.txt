Blood's in the snow, cracks in the mirror
Taking it's toll, got raps to deliver
Knots in the rope, catch in the river
Stabbing in the dark like killers
Try last with your cast iron innards
On a bar, like fools, collapse inwards
I adapt English, you do the maths
Can't retract what's inflicted
Put you on the spot on the dot
I take penalties, drinks on the rocks
And you're shotting it so heavily
Only you finding your heaven brings remedy
Future's round corners, the past's in the mirror
Expand with experience, laugh through the eeriness
Advances are there, take a chance don't fear shit
Clocks stay ticking yet time ain't real is it? Pause
You must climb be prepared to fall down in an instant
Only the trust will dance, enchant listeners
Swim don't drown, get found in the distance
In clouds of persistence, cloud 9 baby
The all seeing eye is my witness, call me a lier?
You'll fry in the fire I'm spitting when flying like Icarus
Too close to the sun my brother
Too close to the sun my brother
Time will heal, all recover
Time will heal, all who suffer
First saw white light now see colour
Bars distinguished not carcinogenic
Genetics are sacred our symbol in essence
That's why I think which seed that I'm sewing
When I'm reeling my poem
Are you facing yourself? Or facing a figure?
Ain't got no knowledge when calling heads pagans
You idiots listen, I said it yes listen
You wanna end up in your home or in prison?
Unlock the door and walk through don't fall victim
Why would I want to? Why'd I feel to?
Why would I lye wide awake like my eyelids see through
Trying to find realms that I ain't yet been too
Eyes of the universe I create actions that captivate people
A vessel for messages I do adhere too
Too close to the sun my brother
Too close to the sun my brother
Time will heal, all recover
Time will heal, all who suffer
First saw white light now see colour
First saw white light now see colour
Flying, Flying, Flying
Flying, Flying, Flying
Flying, Flying
