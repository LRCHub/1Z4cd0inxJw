[00:02.41] Let's sing a song full of hope, full of pain
[00:07.55] Why don't you sing along my friend, for it's our last refrain
[00:13.44] Forever young, ever strong, ever brave
[00:18.69] Memories like this never end, no, they don't fade away
[00:45.69] 
[00:23.05] So when I'm gone, oh when I'm gone
[00:28.79] I'll be right there, close to the sun
[00:33.93] Keep holdin' on, keep holdin' on
[00:39.38] And I'll be right there, close to the sun
[00:44.43] Close to the sun
[00:52.43] 
[00:54.88] Close to the sun
[01:02.88] 
[01:18.25] Here's to the one to let shine through the rain
[01:23.23] The ones who stood for something more
[01:25.87] We won't forget your names
[01:28.97] The tide is high, say goodbye, we're settin' sail
[01:33.55] And all those midnight secrets told, we'll take 'em to the graves
[02:06.05] 
[01:38.46] So when I'm gone, oh when I'm gone
[01:44.16] I'll be right there, close to the sun
[01:49.25] Keep holdin' on, keep holdin' on
[01:54.96] And I'll be right there, close to the sun
[01:59.62] Close to the sun
[02:07.62] 
[02:21.29] Close to the sun
[02:29.29] 
[02:43.34] So when I'm gone, oh when I'm gone
[02:48.85] I'll be right there, close to the sun
[02:54.14] Keep holdin' on, keep holdin' on
[02:59.68] And I'll be right there, close to the sun
[03:04.33] Close to the sun
