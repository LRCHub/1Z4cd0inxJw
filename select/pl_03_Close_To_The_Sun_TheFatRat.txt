Why do birds suddenly appear
everytime you are near?
Just like me, they long to be
close to you
Why do stars fall down from the
sky
Everytime you walk by?
Just like me, they long to be
close to you
On the day that you were born
the angels got together
And decided to create a dream
come true
So they sprinkled moondust in
your hair of gold and starlight
in your eyes of blue
