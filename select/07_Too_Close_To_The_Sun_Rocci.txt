Another close call
Swerving right past all the feelings
I wanna get off
Dancing with death for no reason

Flew to close to the sun
Think we both had enough

And I changed my plans to fight it
But you know that it's good to try
And I think I feel you dying
Don't sink in the world behind you

I wanna feel good
I just wanna feel good

Are we better now?
Back on the shore light and even
I'd never let it go
If I had saw what you seein'

I can't thank you enough
Hope we pick it back up

And I changed my plans to fight it
But you know that it's good to try
And I think I feel you dying
Don't sink in the world behind you

I wanna feel good
I just wanna feel good
