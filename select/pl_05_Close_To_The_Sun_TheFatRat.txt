By the light of the moon I gazed
at your face
It was the middle of June or
maybe in may
I looked at you and you looked
away
Like in a flower in bloom on a
cold summer day
By the light of the moon I
looked in your eyes
Not a moment too soon did I
realize
The world is in tune it tells
you no lies
Like a flower in bloom reaching
up to the skies
Getting close to the sun
Close to the sun
Say goodbye this is your time to
fly
Can’t find the reason why you
should not go
This is your time to fly go
spread your wings on high
But make sure you don’t fly too
close to the sun
Close to the sun
On a cold summer day you said
your goodbyes
And you walked through that door
for the very last time
You turned as you left and you
whispered to me
Always will we love and always
will we be
Close to the sun
Close to the sun
Say goodbye this is your time to
fly
Can’t find the reason why you
should not go
This is your time to fly go
spread your wings on high
But make sure you don’t fly too
close to the sun
Say goodbye this is your time to
fly
Can’t find the reason why you
should not go
This is your time to fly go
spread your wings on high
But make sure you don’t fly too
close to the sun
Close to the sun
Close to the sun
Close to the sun
Close to the sun.
