We were glowing like a flame
Undercover night and day
You took me up so high
It felt like a paradise
Breathing you in, breathing you
out
We felt like shooting stars
But we went up too far
No way to go but down
It was so beautiful
Before the fall
I'm flying too close to the sun
It was so beautiful
Before the fall
I'm flying too close to the sun
I was all yours
I felt the earth turn
Shooting so high
We had to get burned
It was so beautiful
Before the fall
I'm flying too close
I'm flying too close to the sun
Oh I miss you missing me
And all the things we never be
You took me up so high
It felt like a paradise
Breathing you in, breathing you
out
We felt like shooting stars
But we went up too far
No way to go but down
It was so beautiful
Before the fall
I'm flying too close to the sun
It was so beautiful
Before the fall
I'm flying too close to the sun
I was all yours
I felt the earth turn
Shooting so high
We had to get burned
It was so beautiful
Before the fall
I'm flying too close
I'm flying too close to the sun
You've written in my heart
I'll always remember you
Remember me
Together but apart
I'll always remember you
You've set me free
I was all yours
I felt the earth turn
Shooting so high
We had to get burned
It was so beautiful
Before the fall
I'm flying too close
I'm flying too close to the sun
I'm flying too close
I'm flying too close to the sun
I'm flying too close
I'm flying too close to the sun
